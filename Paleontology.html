            <p>Did you know that the open waters around Sardinia were once home to one of the largest predators that has ever existed in Earth’s seas known as Carcharocles megalodon? (seen in Figure 1; Museo PARC, 2024) These predators were about 18 metres long (Pimiento & Balk, 2015), which is comparable to the length of a semi-truck with a trailer! </p>

            <p>It's the field of Paleontology and its enthusiastic scientists that allow us to gain a better insight and understanding into the history of life on Earth, as well as the processes that have shaped it until today. The island of Sardinia is full of numerous geo-paleontological sites, highlighting its great palaeontological heritage (Zoboli, 2023). Historically, Sardinia has been exploited for resources, like limestone and other mineral resources, which lead to an abundance of quarries and natural outcrops on its landscape (Zoboli et al., 2021). These outcrops were studied by renowned paleontologists, including Alberto La Marmora (1789–1863), Johann Bornemann (1831–1896), and Domenico Lovisato (1842–1916), resulting in the geo-paleontological knowledge of Sardinia that we have today (Zoboli et al., 2019). Like this, the prehistoric existence of megalodons was discovered during excavation works in the Orroli area, where paleontologists uncovered teeth of Carcharocles megalodon, the world largest shark, which you can now observe yourself in the P.Ar.C. museum in Genoni (Museo PARC, 2024).</p>

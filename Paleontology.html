            <p>Did you know that the open waters around Sardinia were once home to one of the largest predators that has ever existed in Earth’s seas known as Carcharocles megalodon? (seen in Figure 1; Museo PARC, 2024) These predators were about 18 metres long (Pimiento & Balk, 2015), which is comparable to the length of a semi-truck with a trailer! </p>

            <p>It's the field of Paleontology and its enthusiastic scientists that allow us to gain a better insight and understanding into the history of life on Earth, as well as the processes that have shaped it until today. The island of Sardinia is full of numerous geo-paleontological sites, highlighting its great palaeontological heritage (Zoboli, 2023). Historically, Sardinia has been exploited for resources, like limestone and other mineral resources, which lead to an abundance of quarries and natural outcrops on its landscape (Zoboli et al., 2021). These outcrops were studied by renowned paleontologists, including Alberto La Marmora (1789–1863), Johann Bornemann (1831–1896), and Domenico Lovisato (1842–1916), resulting in the geo-paleontological knowledge of Sardinia that we have today (Zoboli et al., 2019). Like this, the prehistoric existence of megalodons was discovered during excavation works in the Orroli area, where paleontologists uncovered teeth of Carcharocles megalodon, the world largest shark, which you can now observe yourself in the P.Ar.C. museum in Genoni (Museo PARC, 2024).</p>

            <p>Much like their large body size, megalodons possessed incredibly large teeth! In contrast to the tooth of the great white shark shown on the left in Figure 2, a megalodon tooth could reach lengths of up to 20 cm (Museo PARC, 2024).</p>
            <p>However, the exciting paleontological facts about Sardinia do not stop here! Additional fossil evidence revealed that riverbanks were once inhabited by crocodiles, alligators, and gavialoids (Zoboli et al., 2021). Crocodile teeth and other fossils leading to this discovery were found in the Duidduru Paleontological Geosite of Genoni, a rare geo-palaeontological site with a fossilised seabed (Giunone Soc. Coop, 2021). This site, preserved within geological layers dating back to the Miocene, is open for visitors to explore - come and discover some fossils yourself! (more info) If you prefer to be fascinated by a restored skull of the ancient crocodile Tomistoma calaritanum (Figure 3), collected by the paleontologist Domenico Lovisato (Capellini, 1890), you may visit his exposition in The Museo Sardo di Geologia e Paleontologia Domenico Lovisato.</p>

                <p>Did you know that the open waters around Sardinia were once home to one of the largest predators that has ever existed in Earth’s seas known as <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/megalodon--the-truth-about-the-largest-shark-that-ever-lived.html">Carcharocles megalodon</a>? (seen in Figure 1; Museo PARC, 2024) These predators were about 18 metres long (Pimiento & Balk, 2015), which is comparable to the length of a semi-truck with a trailer! </p>

                <p>It's the field of Paleontology and its enthusiastic scientists that allow us to gain a better insight and understanding into the history of life on Earth, as well as the processes that have shaped it until today. The island of Sardinia is full of numerous geo-paleontological sites, highlighting its great palaeontological heritage (Zoboli, 2023). Historically, Sardinia has been exploited for resources, like limestone and other mineral resources, which lead to an abundance of quarries and natural outcrops on its landscape (Zoboli et al., 2021). These outcrops were studied by renowned paleontologists, including Alberto La Marmora (1789–1863), Johann Bornemann (1831–1896), and Domenico Lovisato (1842–1916), resulting in the geo-paleontological knowledge of Sardinia that we have today (Zoboli et al., 2019). Like this, the prehistoric existence of megalodons was discovered during excavation works in the Orroli area, where paleontologists uncovered teeth of Carcharocles megalodon, the world largest shark, which you can now observe yourself in the <a href="https://parcgenoni.com/en/parc-museum/"> P.Ar.C. museum</a> in Genoni (Museo PARC, 2024).</p>

                <p>Much like their large body size, megalodons possessed incredibly large teeth! In contrast to the tooth of the great white shark shown on the left in Figure 2, a megalodon tooth could reach lengths of up to 20 cm (Museo PARC, 2024).</p>
                <p>However, the exciting paleontological facts about Sardinia do not stop here! Additional fossil evidence revealed that riverbanks were once inhabited by crocodiles, alligators, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/gavialidae">gavialoids</a> (Zoboli et al., 2021). Crocodile teeth and other fossils leading to this discovery were found in the Duidduru Paleontological Geosite of Genoni, a rare geo-palaeontological site with a fossilised seabed (Giunone Soc. Coop, 2021). This site, preserved within geological layers dating back to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Miocene-Epoch">Miocene</a>, is open for visitors to explore - come and discover some fossils yourself! (<a href="https://www.museumshop.inlandsardinia.it/biglietteria-musei-di-genoni/">more info</a>) If you prefer to be fascinated by a restored skull of the ancient crocodile Tomistoma calaritanum (Figure 3), collected by the paleontologist Domenico Lovisato (Capellini, 1890), you may visit his exposition in<a href="https://web.unica.it/unica/en/ateneo_s03_ss07.page?contentId=STR4930"> The Museo Sardo di Geologia e Paleontologia Domenico Lovisato</a>.</p>

            <div class="whiteboxoutside">
                <p>Next to Domenico Lovisato, other Paleontologists like Alberto La Marmora helped to establish new taxa and thereby discover Sardinia’s prehistoric populations prior to the island's current geological and ecological state (Zoboli et al., 2021). La Marmora’s multiple collections of fragmented bones from vertebrates that lived during the Pleistocene epoch (Figure 4) allowed for the establishment of a new taxon <a href="https://natuurtijdschriften.nl/pub/523525/CRAN2006023001005.pdf">Cynotherium sardous</a> (Lamarmora, 1857). Cynotherium sardous is the Latin term for a common dog native to Sardinia and Corsica, which went extinct approximately 21,100 years ago (Ciucani et al., 2021). </p>

                <p>The Sulcis-Iglesiente sub-region of Sardinia offers a large amount of diverse geo-paleontological sites, including mining caves, abandoned quarries and several outcrops rich in plant remains (Zoboli, 2023). If you are eager to explore a variety of these unique paleontological sites and gain a deeper understanding of Sardinia’s prehistoric heritage, you can follow a geo-itinerary route proposed by paleontologist Daniel Zoboli in his study (Zoboli, 2023). He evaluated one hundred of the most relevant fossil localities and mapped out three interesting routes (Figure 5), connecting the most interesting spots in a convenient way. </p>

                <p>All Routes start at the <a href="https://www.carboniamusei.it/en/museum-of-sulcitani-paleontological-environments-e-a-martel_7.html">PAS museum</a> each following an individual path and combining different fossil localities. Route 1 moves toward the eastern area of Carbonia, including highlights such as Cannas and Grotta dei Fiori, where you can find vertebrate bone fragments (Zoboli, 2023). Route 2 leads you toward the northern area of Carbonia, in which you can observe different<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Paleozoic-Era"> Palaeozoic</a> geological layers, as well as invertebrate remains inside an abandoned coal mine called “Piolanas” (Zoboli, 2023). Lastly, Route 3 entails the area between Carbonia and Iglesias along which  you can explore various palaeontological sites offering vertebrate, as well as invertebrate remains. Additionally, the route includes abandoned mines such as the laveria of Seddas Moddizzis mine (Zoboli, 2023). To follow a route, you can find the complete itinerary of all three routes<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12371-023-00803-2/tables/1"> here</a>.</p>

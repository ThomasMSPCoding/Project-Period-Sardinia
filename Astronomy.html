                <p>For all astronomy fans and fanatics Sardinia should definitely make the shortlist of locations to visit for its notable stargazing skies. Due to significantly low light pollution,  Sardinia has one of the darkest skies in Europe. This is much to the advantage of the various planetariums, observatories and telescope centers found around the island.  In fact the largest European radio telescope is located near San Basilio in southern Sardinia. Not only do these locations offer tours and educational excursions suitable for various demographics and academic expertise but are also actively used in the scientific research field to investigate and record weather, sun environment and the likes (MULAS, 2023) </p>
                <p>Alongside the below mentioned locations, there are a plethora of desolate locations where light pollution is practically zero. A few examples include: Teulada area, inland of Gallura, the Ogliastra and Bosa (Skies of Sardinia, 2021)</p>
                <h5><strong>Planetario dell’Unione Sarda</strong></h5>
                <p>This is an indoor planetarium offering educational events about the solar system, its planets and celestial bodies. They are continually updating the set ups as new discoveries or problems arise within the astronomy field. They aim to inform and provide sufficient knowledge, shortening the distance between complex themes or concepts and their misconceptions. They also run courses for both adults and children of all ages and educational backgrounds (Il Planetario, 2025). </p>

                <p>This sky observatorium boasts one of the darkest skies of Europe. Built in 1986 it is run by volunteers who share a passion for astronomy with their visitors. There is also a planetarium that most people frequent in the colder winter months. Visits are recommended to be scheduled in advance particularly off season. During the high season when tourism is flourishing many major cultural events are organised.</p>

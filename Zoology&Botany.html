                <p>The beautiful colonies of Greater Flamingos (<i>Phoenicopterus roseus</i>) are a must-see while you are visiting Sardinia. They can be observed in the Molentargius-Saline Park and other wetland coastal areas around the island. Be sure you do not miss them!(Sardegna Turismo: The Park of Molentargius – Saline, 2015)</p>

                <p> A species of lizards that inhabit only Corsica and Sardinia can also be seen during your visit! Fitzinger's Algyroides (<i>Algyroides fitzingeri</i>) are a small lizard species that can be found in Mediterranean shrubbery, temperate forests and shrubland. Not a whole lot of them are sighted and described so maybe you can help!  (Fitzinger’s Algyroides (<i>Algyroides Fitzingeri</i>), 2018)

                    <p>Griffon vultures (<i>Gyps fulvus</i>) can be a truly majestic sight while visiting Sardinia. They once could be found at places all over the island but were mostly wiped out after the Second World War. Since 2015, conservationists have been trying to make this population larger and have succeeded! In 2020, their population was larger by more than 100 individuals than in 2013. That means you have quite a chance to observe them during your visit so keep an eye out!  (Griffon Vulture to Sardinia, n.d.) </p>

They are truly something you will need to see during your visit to Sardinia!  (Sardinia Natour, 2024)

                <p>The Asinara albino donkey (<i>Equus asinus var. albina</i>) is a distinctive variant of the Sardinian donkey, notable for its white coat, pinkish skin, and light-colored eyes. It primarily inhabits the island of Asinara. This kind of  natural wonder happens because of albinism that occurs in animals homozygous for a missense mutation in the tyrosinase gene. (Utzeri et al, 2016) Want to observe these beautiful animals on your own? The easiest way to see them is to take the White Donkey Trail in the Asinara National Park!</p>

                <p>SEAME is a non-profit organisation operating in Sardinia. Its made up of a group of researchers and promoters of sea life protection and conservation in the Mediterranean sea. Their objective is to spread awareness about conservation, educate and spread awareness to the public on why this is vital. They work in close companionship with the University of Sassari and participate with the research they carry out on crustaceans in the mediterranean sea. SEAME is open to the public and one can register to be a researcher with the group for a day, participate and witness the work that they do. The fee for the registration enables SEAME researchers to carry out this much needed research about marine life. They also collaborate with schools of various levels and aim to nourish the love of animals and nature in their students. For more details on the tours and research that SEAME do, check out their webpage and socials.</p>

                <p>As you explore the island of Sardinia, you will find archaeological sites that show the island’s rich and ancient archaeology, often integrated into its natural surroundings. These ancient sites are more than just ruins, they allow us to understand how the earliest inhabitants of Sardinia lived, worked and traded. These sites have helped us uncover the different cultures that have lived on this island. </p>

            <h5><strong>Neolithic period</strong></h5>
            <p>In the Neolithic period, Sardinia was known for its volcanic obsidian, mainly extracted from Monte Arci (Lugliè et al., 2007). Obsidian from Sardinia was found on other western Mediterranean sites indicating trade networks during this period (Marcus et al., 2020). This became a key material for making tools in the Neolithic, shown by different sites where obsidian artifacts have been found. </p>
            <p>One of these sites is Su Carroppu Rock Shelter, where 101 obsidian artifacts from the Early Neolithic layer were found. The artefacts are partly kept in the<a href="https://www.carboniamusei.it/en/museum-archaeological-villa-sulcis_6.html" target="_blank"> archaeological Museum of Villa Sulcis</a> in Carbonia and partly in the<a href="https://museinazionalicagliari.cultura.gov.it/" target="_blank"> National Archaeological Museum of Cagliari</a>. Visiting the Su Carroppu Rock Shelter could be an intriguing experience since you will be Mo able to find a cave where the first civilization of Sardinia may have lived! ‌(Luglie., 2015).</p>

            <p>During the Neolithic, the use of pottery had a central role in daily life and ritual practices. Two distinct styles of pottery have been found in Sardinian culture: San Ciriaco ceramics and Cardium-Impressed Ware. </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="textimage">
            <p>San Ciriaco ceramics have been found in Monte d’Accoddi! which is another site from the Neolithic period worth visiting. You will be able to find it on the map located in the homepage. The site evolved from a simple altar in the Neolithic period to a complex step-pyramid structure when transitioning to the Early Bronze Age, which relates to the shift from the Ozieri to the Sub-Ozieri cultural phases (Grazia Melis, 2025).</p>

        <div class="whiteboxoutside">
            <h5><strong>Chalcolithic period</strong></h5>
            <p>Now, moving on to the Chalcolithic period also known as the Eneolithic period, the use of obsidian shifted increasing the local use and showing a decline in long-distance trade networks (Freund, 2014). This period had different cultural phases. During the Early Chalcolithic the Sub-Ozieri and Filigosa cultures were present, the Abealzu culture appeared in the Middle Chalcolithic, the Late Chalcolithic was characterised by the Monte Claro culture and finally the Bell Beaker culture emerged during the Final Chalcolithic (Pau, 2013).</p>
            <p>The Sub-Ozieri cultural phase has been observed in the second construction phase of Monte d’Accoddi, when the site is a complex step-pyramid structure. During the Upper Neolithic this monument was inhabited, according to data from pottery finds. However, throughout the Chalcholithic period this monument was constantly in use, as observed through the findings of several artefacts made of metal. During the Sub-Ozieri cultural phase, metal artefacts became more common but were not recognized as a material of high value or symbolic significance. In the Filigosa phase, metal began appearing in funerary contexts, showing its growing recognition as a valuable material (Grazia Melis., 2025). </p>
            <p>The Monte Claro cultural phase during the late Chalcolithic can be observed through ceramics and different artefacts which can be found in the Musei Nazionali di Cagliari. (Museo Archeologico Nazionale Di Cagliari, 2017) Moreover, archeological sites corresponding to this cultural phase have been found like the Padru Jossu tomb, where stratigraphic evidence of Monte Claro materials has been found (Pau, 2013). </p>

            <p>Finally, the Bell Beaker culture persisted until the Early Bronze Age. Over 70 sites from this cultural phase have been identified mainly in Western Sardinia, even though they have also been found in central and southern areas. Most Bell Beaker finds are reused Neolithic structures used in funerary contexts like the Domus de Janas tomb or the Pranu Mutteddu tomb, which you will be able to find on the map. Another site worth visiting is the Santa Vittoria tomb, which is the only tomb attributed to Bell Beaker construction (Pau, 2013).  </p>
            <p>Ceramics, beads, pendants, weapons and tools were found in several archeological burial sites from this period. The pottery from the Bell Beaker cultural phase are characterized by bell-shaped vessels with rounded profiles and flat bases. To decorate these ceramics techniques such as incision, comb-impressed designs and maritime-style decorations were used. (Pau, 2013) You can find Bell Beaker ceramics in the <a href="https://museinazionalicagliari.cultura.gov.it/" target="_blank">Cagliari National Museum</a>!</p>

            <h5><strong>Nuragic Period</strong></h5>
        </div>


        <!--Image + Text aside-->
        <div class="textimage">
            <p>Finally, the Nuragic period was known for it monumental architecture specially the Nuraghi structures and Giants’ Tomb. The Nuraghi are tower-like stone structures which have a defensive purpose to surveil and protect the island (Riccardo Cicilloni, 2020). The Giants’ Tombs are collective burial sites which in some cases derive from dolmens becoming elongated monuments (MacKenzie, 1910).  Some examples that you will be able to find on our homepage map are Sa Domu 'e S'Orku Giant’s Tomb and Nuraghe Santu Antine which can be found in Santu Antine Nuragic Complex.</p>

            <p>During this period a rise of sanctuaries was observed, where significant archaeological evidence, such as hoards and metal assemblages from sacred sites was found (Ialongo, 2013). If you are interested in the Nuragic civilization you should definitely visit Santa Vittoria Sanctuary, a vital testament to Nuragic Sardinia!</p>
            <p>Once again, obsidian mainly from Monte Arci was used for making tools and internally traded throughout the island. In the Marghine region you will be able to find nuraghi and tombs such as Duos Nuraghes and Ortu Còmidu where obsidian artefacts from this period have been found (Freund & Tykot, 2011). </p>
